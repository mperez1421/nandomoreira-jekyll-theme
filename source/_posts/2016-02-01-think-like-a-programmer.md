Growth Mindset. The importance of developing basic abilities through determination and hard work. In order to think like a programmer one must be in a “growth mindset.” This is a self theory where everything can get better over time and practice. Now if one were to be in a “fixed mindset,” they would believe that they’re either smart or dumb, talented or not, etc. you get the gist. A person who has a “fixed mindset” can only see things as how they appear. They believe that people are born with certain abilities and how some can do more than others. This mindset is easily recognizable when people are starting with sentences like, “I can’t do this because..” or “They’re too smart because..” or “I am..” These types of people believe that they can’t do something or say these things to excuse themselves from failure. One can easily get out of the mindset by first identifying a fixed mindset. Then one must go about failure, success, life challenges, almost everything in a optimistic point of view, readjusting everything. Sometimes with the easiest phrases like, “I can do this,” or “Everything is possible with hard work.” Setting your brain to reframe everything differently will only help you get into a “growth mindset,” and prepare you to think like a programmer. Once you adapt to this type of mindset, everything will come easier with time. Being a programmer is just an example of how you can prosper at a certain area when you adjust yourself to a “growth mindset.” All you need to remember are the five major points of a “growth mindset”: learn to not quit until you’ve finished (endurance), remember why you’re doing it, remind yourself that the key to success is by struggling first, “reframe failure,” what can you do to improve from next time, and embrace challenges. Once you get all of these down, then you're set!
